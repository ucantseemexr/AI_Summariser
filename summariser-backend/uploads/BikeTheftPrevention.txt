Crime Prevention Tips

Here are some measures you can take to avoid having your bicycle stolen in the future:

Keep your bicycle at home when you are not using it.

If you need to park your bicycle at a public place, choose one with high human traffic preferably with CCTV monitoring.

Secure your bicycle to a permanent structure such as a bicycle rack.

Use a good quality lock such as a U-lock.

Ensure all removable bicycle components are locked or secured.

Make permanent identification marks such as engravings on the body of your bicycle.
