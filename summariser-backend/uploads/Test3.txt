In recent years, climate change has accelerated due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Global temperatures have risen by an average of 1.2Â°C since pre-industrial times. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and melting polar ice caps are direct consequences of this phenomenon. Nations are working to meet the Paris Agreement targets, but progress remains uneven. 

Renewable energy adoption has gained traction, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia. Wind and solar installations are expanding rapidly, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Governments are offering subsidies and incentives to promote green technologies. However, developing countries face challenges due to limited infrastructure and financial constraints.
